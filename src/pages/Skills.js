				<p>Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 10 years ago, Iâ€™ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create web products for both business and consumer use.</p>
				<p>I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices. The main area of my expertise is front-end development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and medium web apps, custom plugins, features, animations, and coding interactive layouts.</p>
				<p>I also have full-stack developer experience with popular open-source CMS like (WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Keystone.js and others) .</p>
