				<h1>Who am I ?</h1>
				<p>
					I am a front-end developer passionate with React.js! I am a problem
					solver, and I love being able to create responsive effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am a proud hispanic currently residing in the Bay Area. Aside from
					my days in coding, I also love sports, travelling, outdoor activities,
					and my family.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ever since I’ve entered the world of coding, I’ve been sucked in
					since, and I hope to find the opportunity to grow and learn more as a
					developer.
